### Airbnb NYC Data Analysis using Python:  

Since its launch in 2008, Airbnb has revolutionized the way people travel, offering unique and personalized stays across the globe. What started as a small idea has now become a worldwide phenomenon, connecting millions of guests and hosts.

#### **Project Overview**  
This project analyzes Airbnb listings in New York City to uncover pricing trends, neighborhood popularity, and host activity. The dataset used is the **Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset**, which includes details about listings such as price, availability, location, and reviews.  

#### **Objectives**  
- Understand pricing trends across different boroughs.  
- Identify the most and least expensive neighborhoods.  
- Analyze host activity and the impact of reviews on pricing.  
- Visualize geographic distributions of listings.  

#### **Technologies Used**  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (for data manipulation)  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (for visualization)  
- **Folium** (for mapping)  
- **Scikit-learn** (for predictive modeling)  

#### **Steps Involved**  

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
   - Load the dataset using Pandas.  
   - Handle missing values and remove outliers.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Summary statistics of price, availability, and number of reviews.  
   - Distribution of listings across boroughs (Manhattan, Brooklyn, etc.).  
   - Correlation analysis between price and features like room type, location, and reviews.  
   - Geospatial Analysis of Airbnb Listings in NYC

3. **Visualization**  
   - Bar plots for borough-wise price distribution.  
   - Heatmaps to show price concentration.  
   - Interactive maps using **Folium** to visualize the location of listings.
